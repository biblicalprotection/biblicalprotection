## 21. For residents in the United States-- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:

21.1 The BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions in this paragraph 21 apply to all Disputes between you and Biblical Protection and/or our parents, subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to the Applications and Services. Paragraph 21 also applies to any Dispute between you and any Biblical Protection Affiliates, each of which is an intended third-party beneficiary of paragraph 21. For the purposes of paragraph 21, “Affiliate” shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Biblical Protection, where ‘control’ means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity’s capital or equivalent voting rights and “Dispute” shall include any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and Biblical Protection (or any Biblical Protection Affiliates) arising out of or relating to this agreement, the Services, or any other transaction involving you and Biblical Protection, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.

21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached by email to support@biblicalprotection.faith. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

21.3 Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph 21.2, then You and Biblical Protection agree that all Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration according to this agreement. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. Under this agreement, binding arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, a nationally recognized arbitration authority, under its procedures then in effect for consumer related disputes, but excluding any rules that permit joinder or class actions in arbitration (for more detail on procedure, see paragraph 21.5 below). You understand and agree that (a) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this paragraph 21, (b) this agreement memorialises a transaction in interstate commerce, and (c) this paragraph 21 shall survive termination of this agreement.

21.4 Arbitration Procedure: If you or Biblical Protection commences arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect when the arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class or representative basis (the “JAMS Rules”), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must follow applicable law. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is excluded from arbitration under paragraph 21.6. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. In some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in San Francisco, California, at your option. Instructions for initiating an arbitration are available at the JAMS website and toll-free number referenced above.

21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.

21.7 30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the "Binding Arbitration," "Location," and "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by sending a scanned, signed notice of your decision to opt-out to support@biblicalprotection.faith The notice must be sent within 30 days of the earlier of your first download of the applicable Application or commencing use of our Services (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the earliest of the date on which you first download the applicable Application or access or commence use the applicable Service); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

21.8 Changes to this paragraph: We will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this paragraph. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.

## 22. JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW

Our Applications and other Services are made available subject to these terms. This paragraph explains which laws apply to these terms.

22.1 Except for paragraph 21, the laws of England shall govern the interpretation of these terms and apply to claims for breach of it, without reference to conflict of laws principles. All other claims, including claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and claims in negligence and tort, will be subject to the laws of the country in which you are resident. If there is a dispute between us regarding these Terms of Use, then that dispute will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of England unless the law in your country of residence allows you to choose the courts of that country for the dispute in question.

22.2 For residents in the United States: You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal courts in San Fransisco, California to resolve any claims that are subject to exceptions to the arbitration agreement described in paragraph 21 above, or otherwise determined not to be arbitrable.

22.3 If you are resident outside the United States and you are entitled to commence and/or participate in legal proceedings within the United States, then you agree that you will be bound by the BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions above.
